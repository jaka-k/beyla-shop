? Next.js for Static Site Generator
? Integrate with Tailwind CSS (w/ JIT mode)

I decided to do this project in Next.js because of its superior SSR abilities towards a regular React.js project.

The choice of Tailwindcss as the CSS framework was mainly because of its convinience of writting CSS directly in JS code.

Instead of using a UI framework like Bootstrap, I used componenets from different UI kits that were written in Tailwind, which I coul then costumize.

Nonethless the componennts need some adjustments for Next.js



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
