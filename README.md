## MERN Shop

The goal of this project was to facilitate my recently accuired knowledge of the Redux state managemnt library. The other goal of this project was to produce a project where I combined React and Node, which is commonly refered as the MERN stack.

More specifically the Next.js framework was used for the frontend because of its superior SSR abilities in comparison with a plain React.js project.

Instead of using a UI framework like Bootstrap, I used some premade componenets from UI kits that were written in Tailwind, which i then costumized for my needs. There were also some components completly design by me in Tailwind.
The choice of Tailwindcss as the CSS framework was mainly because of its convinience of writting CSS directly in JS code.

The biggest challange was implementing some of the concepty i learned in React to Next.js.

The small server is written in Node and Express (as i implied with the MERN stack)

## WARNING!!! ONLY FOR LEARNING PURPUSES!

node-fetch vunrability! Run npm audit on ./frontend for more info.

? Next.js for Static Site Generator
? Integrate with Tailwind CSS (w/ JIT mode)

Frontend not done as meticoulously as it should, cause this project is a leraning project where i try to integrete an node server with an next app.

Nonethless the componennts need some adjustments for Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
